## Executive Summary

A large NHS Trust piloted an AI agent to generate applicant shortlists, addressing the time-consuming process of manually screening candidates.

- 28 shortlists generated  
- 1,333 applicants reviewed  
- Shortlists produced in hours, not days  
- >1,750 hours saved per year  

---

## The Challenge

- 500+ roles advertised annually  
- Average of 47 applicants per role (often 100+)  
- Senior medics pulled away from patients to shortlist  
- Delays due to staff availability  
- Inconsistent and unfair human shortlisting  

---

## The Solution

Developed an AI Agent using LLMs:

1. **Input**: job description + applicants (single PDF)  
2. **Pre-processing**: extract criteria via LLM  
3. **Processing**: score candidates against criteria  
4. **Output**: ranked list with full audit trail  

---

## Results

- **98% accurate** shortlists (vs. human benchmark)  
- **One FTE saved** (~1,750 hours annually)  
- **Fair & thorough**: every applicant scored, no skipping  
- **Audit trail**: every score explained and recorded  

---

## Innovations

- **Referee Architecture**: Gemini (Google) + Llama (Meta), Claude (Anthropic) as referee  
- **Enrichment Step**: added context for qualifications, jargon, examples  
- **Hyper-Granular Approach (1,000+ prompts)**: smaller tasks improved accuracy  

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Data Security**: NHS-compliant servers, GDPR, SOC2  
- **Bias**: no bias found; assessments tied to published criteria  
- **Transparency**: every decision explained with audit trail  

---

## Call to Action

This pilot shows AI shortlisting delivers **faster, fairer, cheaper recruitment** in the NHS.  

- Scalable to other Trusts  
- Adaptable across roles  
- Unlocks time savings and reduces costs
